# Hey ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm Pravieen and I'm a junior pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering . I am very passionate about App Development in addition to a leisurely and cursory interest in Business and Management. I am actively pursuing several courses on online resources and projects in order to develop my skills. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Flutter and Dart.
